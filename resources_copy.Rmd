# Tutorials

The above exercises are adapted from tutorials written by Tracy Heath, JoÃ«lle Barido-Sottani and co-authors. 


## Inference

Extended versions of both tutorials can be found on the [Taming the Beast site](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/FBD-tutorial/) and the [RevBayes tutorial page](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/).

## Simulations

You can also use simulations to explore assumptions of the FBD process (and related birth-process models) using the [FossilSim](https://github.com/fossilsim/fossilsim) R package application [FossilSimShiny](https://github.com/fossilsim/FossilSimShiny). Associated exercise available [here](https://phylogenetics-fau.netlify.app/fossilsimshiny).
