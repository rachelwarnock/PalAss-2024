title: "Bayesian divergence time estimation"
---

\

# Choose your own adventure

These exercises focus on the use of the fossilised birth-death (FBD) process for Bayesian divergence time estimation using a dataset of living and extinct bears.

1. Dating [exercise](exercise-01.html) using [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) 
2. Dating [exercise](exercise-02.html) using [BEAST2](https://www.beast2.org/)

You will also need to install the software [Tracer](http://beast.community/tracer) and [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases).

Click on one of the links at the top to begin!

3. You can also use simulations to explore assumptions of the FBD process (and related birth-process models) using the [FossilSim](https://github.com/fossilsim/fossilsim) R package application [FossilSimShiny](https://github.com/fossilsim/FossilSimShiny). Associated exercise available [here](https://phylogenetics-fau.netlify.app/fossilsimshiny).

# Additional resources

The above exercises are adapted from tutorials written by Tracy Heath, Joëlle Barido-Sottani and co-authors. 

Extended versions of both tutorials can be found on the [Taming the Beast site](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/FBD-tutorial/) and the [RevBayes tutorial page](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/).

The morphology only analysis was originally published [here](https://hal.inria.fr/PGE/hal-02536394).
